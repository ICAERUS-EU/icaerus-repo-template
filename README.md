## Summary
This GitHub repository template is designed for the ICAERUS-EU project, providing a standardized structure for managing and sharing project-related code, documentation, and resources. It includes essential folders and files to help streamline development, collaboration, and tracking progress within the project.

## Readme requirements
The idea is that this readme text is copied and adjusted for your own project-repo readme. 
Start by [creating a repo on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo), from your GitHub account. 

### Header
You can copy-and-paste the header and shields directly into your own readme file (please change the `repo-title` in the urls to the correct ones).
```markdown

```
### ICAERUS organization
You can decide later or immediately to publish it under the ICAERUS organization (if you are already a member). **If your are not a member yet of this organization, please send an e-mail to [jurrian.doornbos@wur.nl](mailto:jurrian.doornbos@wur.nl?subject=ICAERUS-Github-access) with your GitHub account information: email/username.**

You can change it to the ICAERUS organization also [later down the line](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository) if you are not immediatly ready yet. Make sure to change all the URLs in the headers, image, etc. to reflect this transfer: `https://github.com/jurriandoornbos/uavgeo` -> **`https://github.com/icaerus-eu/uavgeo`**


## Repo requirements
### License
Choose a license and LICENSE file. Preferably something open-source like GPL-v3.
### Folder structure
From there on in, you can decide on folder structure which makes the most sense for the project. For some ideas of folder structures you can do [some research](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/file-structure/), or use what is already logical to you/your organization.
```
Ideas:
- .github/                   # GitHub-specific files and templates
  - workflows/               # Workflow configuration files (e.g., CI/CD)
- docs/                      # Documentation files (e.g., user guides)
- src/                       # Source code for your project
- tests/                     # Test files
- data/                      # Data files (if applicable)
- config/                    # Configuration files
- scripts/                   # Utility scripts
- public/                    # Publicly accessible assets (e.g., web assets)
- dist/                      # Compiled or distribution files
- examples/                  # Example code or usage examples
- LICENSE                    # Your project's license file
- README.md                  # Repository README
```

You can also check out [`uavgeo`](https://github.com/icaerus-eu/uavgeo) for an example `python` project folder/file structure that is published and available through `pip`. Or [`p2p-ros`](https://github.com/jurriandoornbos/p2p_ros) for a ROS related project.

### Topics
To help out findability, and usability in the ICAERUS platform (WP6), the repo's should be [labeled correctly using GitHub Topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics). These topics are still under construction and debate, but here is an idea of what we can use:

* UC related: `uc1`, `uc2`, `uc3`, `uc4`, `uc5`
* WP related: `wp2`, `wp3`, `wp6`
* Content related: 
    - `ml`: Machine Learning (statistical learning)
    - `dl`: Deep Learning
    - `cv`: Computer vision
    - `hsi`/`msi`: Hyperspectral/Multispectral imaging
    - `flight-control`: Flight Control
    - `path-planning`: Path planning algorithms/implementations
    - `dataset`: Dataset related information/explanation/links/etc.
    - `sim`: Simulation related
    - `framework`: Framework/architectural/backbone code
    - `ros`: Robotics Operating System packages
* Topic related:
    - `vineyards`: Vineyards
    - `spraying`: Drone Spraying
    - `forest`: 
* Location related:
    - `spain`
    - `macedonia`
* We should be able to come up with a lot more, and stick to these for the whole project.

Please choose no more than 10 Topics, although 3 or 4 should be able to cover the whole repo.
